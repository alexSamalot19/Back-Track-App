## Description

Back Track is group activity tracker which uses the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to encourage competition with leaderboards for users who schedule the most hours in a particular topic.

The user begins at the home page:

If there are events scheduled for the day they are displayed the list of users with a pie chart of how many total hours each member has logged.

Adding a new user:

When the information is filled out the user will appear on the page and is also available on the home page as well. They can click their name to go to their individual page shown below.

![UserPage](client/public/img/UserPage.png)

Here they can see bar graphs of all of the topics they are signed up for with all hours put in by each member. They can also see their personal events, add hours to their respective topics and see the group calendar.

## Role in Development

My name is Alex I am a bootcamp student whose portfolio can be found
[here](https://alexsamalot19.github.io/Samalot-Alexander-Portfolio/).

I developed this app to collect data from the Google calendar API, store user information in the database and design an intuitive and stylish front end. The site is deployed to Heroku [here](https://back-track.herokuapp.com/).
